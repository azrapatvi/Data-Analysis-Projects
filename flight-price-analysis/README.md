# ✈️ Flight Price Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on flight price data to understand how different factors such as airline, source, destination, journey date, duration, and number of stops influence ticket prices.

The notebook is designed to showcase a structured EDA workflow suitable for data analysis portfolios.

## 🔍 Analysis Workflow

### 1️⃣ Importing Required Libraries
Essential libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn are used for data handling and visualization.

### 2️⃣ Loading the Dataset
The dataset is loaded and initial inspection is performed to understand its structure.

### 3️⃣ Understanding the Data
- Dataset shape  
- Data types  
- Summary statistics  
- Missing values analysis  

### 4️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handling missing values  
- Converting date and time features  
- Cleaning duration and stop-related columns  
- Dropping unnecessary features  

### 5️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is performed to answer key questions such as:
- How are flight prices distributed?
- Which airlines are the most expensive?
- How do number of stops affect ticket prices?
- Does journey date or month impact pricing?
- How do source and destination cities influence fares?

### 6️⃣ Data Visualization
- Histograms  
- Boxplots  
- Bar plots  
- Feature-wise comparisons

## 📈 Key Insights

- Flight prices show a **right-skewed distribution**
- Airlines and number of stops significantly affect ticket prices
- Flights with more stops are generally cheaper
- Journey date and route play an important role in price variation
- Certain source cities contribute more to total ticket prices
